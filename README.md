# DriveRCart
ESP32 controlled RC-Car. Designed to be easily implemented by anyone interested in doing so. This project takes advantage of the 
ESP32 WiFI Module. This project is also designed to be extensible, just keep in mind your total power draw.
This particular implementation uses an Xbox Series X/S gamepad to control the RC car, but can be easily modified to use any input device that can be 
plugged into a computer.

### Needed materials
- ESP32 Microcontroller with MicroPython installed
- Ultrasonic sensor
- DHT 11 sensor
- L298N power supply module
- LEDs
- Lots of jumper wires

### Dependencies
- An IDE that supports MicroPython, such as Pycharm
- Python >= 3.10

### References
This project wouldnÂ´t be possible without Rui and Sara Santos, from Random Nerd Tutorials (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/). Be sure to 
check their webpage if you are interested in building more MicroPython tools! :)
